# 👋 Hi, I'm Hari — AI/ML Engineer

I build practical AI systems that solve real problems — mainly around **RAG**, **LLMs**, **NLP**, and **MLOps**.  
Most of my work focuses on turning unstructured data into useful products: search, chatbots, automation pipelines, and model deployments.

## 🤠 About Me  
**AI/ML Engineer | RAG Systems | LLM Apps | LangChain | NLP | MLOps**

I enjoy working across the stack — from data preparation and embeddings, to API layers and deployment.  
I like understanding how things work under the hood and making them reliable enough for real users.

## 🔭 Current Focus  
Right now I'm focusing on **RAG + LLM applications** — especially improving retrieval quality, latency, and evaluation.  
Most of my repos here revolve around practical examples of production-style AI systems.

---

## 📲 Project Highlights  
Here are a few repos that reflect my recent work:

### 🔹 **rag-qa-chatbot**  
RAG pipeline using LangChain + OpenAI + Pinecone with a clean FastAPI wrapper.

### 🔹 **ocr-cv-pipeline**  
OCR + CNN pipeline for extracting fields from invoices, IDs, and scanned documents.

### 🔹 **llm-finetune-lora**  
LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning workflow with evaluation, training logs, and reproducible configs.

### 🔹 **semantic-search-faiss**  
Local vector search engine using Sentence Transformers + FAISS with a small demo app.

## 🥉 How I Work  
- I prefer **simple, readable code** over clever one-liners  
- I write tests early and treat them like documentation  
- I keep projects modular: `src/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `docs/`  
- I focus on **clean APIs**, not just models  
- I try to make everything reproducible — Docker, Makefiles, env templates  
- I believe good engineering is about trade-offs, not perfection

## 🎉 Fun Fact  
I learn faster by building things than reading about them — which is why most of my GitHub is hands-on projects.
